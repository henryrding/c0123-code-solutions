              <h3>Making the Decision To Switch</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">You should only move forwards with canvas if and when you have determined that
                we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our
                goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one
                way of the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas applivation for
                you to get a fell for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
                about their experience.

              <h3>Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing inferfaces and community
                resources. At a minumum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your
                payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll
                also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that
                sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
                information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we
                will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

              <h3>Data Migration</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which
                we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted an on-premise EMR
                databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
                information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.
                While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has
                been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

              <h3>Training and Site Visit</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,
                charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks
                prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
                management, and billing workflows. Either before of during go-live, one of our
                team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and
                training.

              <h3>Go-Live and Tuning</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be
                with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure
                everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a
                handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,
                setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.
                We are here to help with it all.

              <h3>Sustained Performance</h3>
              <p class="negative-margin">All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide
                support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not
                meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments
                back. (We do not expect this to happen): For our Standard plans, we also offer a
                MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for
                everyone, we provide unlimited support at no charge. We expect this to be a
                long, productive partnership for us both.
